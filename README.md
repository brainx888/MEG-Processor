# MEG-Processor
MEG Processor is a software package designed for analyzing magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. This tool is particularly notable for its ability to handle large datasets in MEG, EEG,  ECoG, iEEG, sEEG, MRI, CT, and other neuroimages. 

Key features of MEG Processor include:
•	Spectral Analysis: It systematically transforms time-domain data into frequency-domain spectrograms, revealing the time-frequency context of high-frequency signals.
•	Source Localization: The software can volumetrically localize magnetic sources across multiple frequency bands.
•	Novel Algorithms: It incorporates advanced algorithms such as wavelet-based beamforming, virtual sensors, accumulated spectrograms, and accumulated source imaging12.
 MEG Processor is developed to enhance the precision of non-invasive techniques for localizing seizure onset regions, which is crucial for epilepsy research and treatment.
